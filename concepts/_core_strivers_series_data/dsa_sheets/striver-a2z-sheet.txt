Note
    1. The Series doesn’t focus on any specific programming language. Instead, it emphasizes logic and uses pseudocode.
    2. The first two basic videos might use C++, but for Java tutorials, you can watch other YouTube videos. When tackling core problems of data structures and algorithms (DSA), the Series uses pseudocode that isn’t tied to any particular programming language.
    3. However, you can find code examples in your preferred language in the notes and articles provided.
