Striver DP Series : Dynamic Programming Problems
    Dynamic Programming can be described as storing answers to various sub-problems to be used later whenever required to solve the main problem.

    The two common dynamic programming approaches are:
        1. Memoization: Known as the “top-down” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of the main problem to the base cases.
        2. Tabulation: Known as the “bottom-up ” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of solving the base cases to the main problem.
